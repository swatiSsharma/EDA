# EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
This README provides an introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and outlines the essential steps involved in conducting EDA on a dataset.

#### What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and summarizing data to gain insights, detect patterns, and identify potential relationships between variables. It involves visualizing data, calculating descriptive statistics, and conducting preliminary analyses to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

EDA serves as a crucial initial step in the data analysis process as it helps to:

     Identify data quality issues, missing values, or outliers.
     Explore the distribution and central tendencies of variables.
     Discover patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data.
     Formulate hypotheses and generate insights for further analysis.

#### Steps in Exploratory Data Analysis
    1. Data Collection
Gather the dataset to be analyzed. This can involve various data sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, APIs, or external files. Ensure that the data is properly documented and organized.

    2. Data Cleaning
Preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. Handle missing values, outliers, or inconsistent formatting. Perform data transformations or feature engineering as necessary.
   
    3. Data Visualization
Create visual representations of the data using plots, charts, or graphs. Explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and detect outliers. Common visualizations include scatter plots, histograms, box plots, bar charts, or heatmaps.

    4. Summary Statistics
Calculate descriptive statistics to summarize the central tendency, variability, and distribution of variables. Generate measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, or percentiles. Summarize the relationships between variables using correlation matrices or cross-tabulations.

    5. Data Exploration
Analyze relationships and patterns in the data. Explore associations between variables through statistical tests, such as t-tests or chi-square tests. Investigate the impact of different factors on the outcome of interest. Look for interesting subgroups or segments within the data.

    6. Iteration and Refinement
Iterate through the above steps, refining the analysis and exploring additional aspects of the data as new insights emerge. Update visualizations or summary statistics based on new findings or hypotheses.

    7. Documentation and Reporting
Document the findings, insights, and any decisions made during the EDA process. Prepare a report or presentation summarizing the analysis, including visualizations, key findings, and any recommendations for further analysis.

# 1. Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in statistics that allows us to make inferences and draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis (H₀) and the alternative hypothesis (H₁), and using statistical evidence to determine which hypothesis is more plausible.

In this readme, we will cover the basic steps involved in hypothesis testing, including the below and some questions:

    1. Formulating the null and alternative hypotheses.
    2. Choosing an appropriate significance level.
    3. Selecting a statistical test.
    4. Collecting and analyzing the data.
    5. Interpreting the test results.
    6. Drawing conclusions and making decisions.
