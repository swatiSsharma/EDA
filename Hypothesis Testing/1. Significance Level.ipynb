    ">> The significance level, also known as alpha (α), represents the maximum acceptable probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis. In hypothesis testing, we set a threshold for the level of evidence required to reject the null hypothesis. If the calculated p-value is less than the significance level (α), we reject the null hypothesis. By setting a lower significance level, we decrease the probability of falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis, indicating a higher level of confidence in our test results."
