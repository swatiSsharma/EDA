# EDA - Hypothesis Testing
Welcome to the Hypothesis Testing Readme! This document serves as a guide to understanding the concept of hypothesis testing and its application in statistical analysis. Whether you are a student, researcher, or data analyst, this readme will provide you with a solid foundation for conducting hypothesis tests and interpreting their results.

Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in statistics that allows us to make inferences and draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis (H₀) and the alternative hypothesis (H₁), and using statistical evidence to determine which hypothesis is more plausible.

In this readme, we will cover the basic steps involved in hypothesis testing, including:

Formulating the null and alternative hypotheses.
Choosing an appropriate significance level.
Selecting a statistical test.
Collecting and analyzing the data.
Interpreting the test results.
Drawing conclusions and making decisions.

By understanding and following these steps, you will be able to apply hypothesis testing to a wide range of scenarios, including medical research, social sciences, quality control, and much more.
